summary: "Headlines love to report pandemic learning loss in \"months of learning,\" but that number is far more slippery than it sounds. The same test-score gap can translate into wildly different months depending on which benchmark you pick, which assessment you use, and which students you're comparing. We walk through the key choices researchers face when calculating this metric and show how each one can swing the results. The takeaway: months of learning can be a useful shorthand, but only if researchers are transparent about the assumptions baked into the denominator."
