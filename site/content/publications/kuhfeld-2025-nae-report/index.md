summary: "Districts spent billions of ESSER dollars on three recovery strategies backed by strong pre-pandemic evidence: ELA curriculum, high-dosage tutoring, and summer programs. But running these programs during an ongoing crisis, at a scale no one had attempted, exposed familiar problems: too few staff, too little coordination, and contexts that didn't match the original research. These strategies can improve student learning. The hard part is building the conditions for them to actually work."
