summary: "Four large districts rolled out tutoring, small-group instruction, and extended learning time during 2021-22 to help students recover from pandemic losses. The programs reached fewer students than planned and produced little measurable effect on math or reading scores. District leaders traced the shortfall to staffing gaps, scheduling conflicts, and programs that couldn't operate at the intensity the research says they need."
