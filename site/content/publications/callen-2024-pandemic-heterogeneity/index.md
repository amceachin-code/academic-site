summary: "The pandemic hit hardest for students who were already behind, and the gap between lower- and higher-achieving students widened significantly. But the more striking finding is what drove that widening: the school a student attended explains about three-quarters of the achievement gap growth in math. Pandemic learning loss wasn't just about individual circumstances. School and district decisions mattered enormously, which means targeted, school-level recovery strategies aren't just helpful, they're essential."
