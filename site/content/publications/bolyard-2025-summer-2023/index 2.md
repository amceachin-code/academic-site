summary: "Summer school is back for round two, and the results are cautiously encouraging. Across eight large districts serving 400,000 students, 2023 summer programs again produced modest but real gains in math, while reading remained stubbornly flat. One bright spot: students who attended for a second consecutive summer did just as well, or better, than first-timers. That's good news for districts betting on summer school as a long-term recovery strategy. It won't close the gap overnight, but it keeps working for kids who keep showing up."
