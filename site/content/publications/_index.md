<p>
I study how education policies and programs affect students, and, critically,
which students they affect most.
</p>
<p>
Four themes run through this work. Much of my recent research focuses on
<strong>out-of-school and disrupted learning</strong>: the COVID-19 pandemic's toll
on achievement, summer learning loss, and whether recovery interventions can
close the gap. A second line examines <strong>accountability</strong>, how federal
and state policies like NCLB, ESEA waivers, and ESSA shape school and teacher
quality. I also study <strong>exclusionary practices</strong>: discipline disparities,
curricular tracking, and how school structures deepen segregation. Finally, my
work on <strong>school choice</strong> asks whether charters, virtual schooling, and
choice markets improve outcomes or simply reshuffle them.

  <span class="pub-theme-description">This line of research examines what happens to student learning outside the traditional school year and during periods of disruption. My work documents summer learning loss patterns, evaluates the effectiveness of summer school programs, and studies the educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of remote instruction and academic recovery interventions.</span>

  <h3 class="pub-card-title">Impacts of Academic Recovery Interventions on Student Achievement in 2022-23</h3>
  <p class="pub-card-summary">COVID catch-up programs promised a lot but delivered less than hoped. Across eight school districts in 2022-23, most programs reached fewer students than planned and produced few measurable gains. The exception: intensive interventions like subject-specific tutoring, small-group reading, and placement with highly effective teachers actually moved the needle. The lesson is clear but humbling: intensive support works, it's just really hard to pull off at scale.</p>

  <h3 class="pub-card-title">Summer School as a Learning Loss Recovery Strategy After COVID-19: Evidence from Summer 2022</h3>
  <p class="pub-card-summary">Summer school seemed like an obvious fix for pandemic learning loss, and many districts doubled down on it. But a look at eight districts serving 400,000 students tells a more sobering story. Attendance was low (only 13% of students participated), and the academic gains were modest at best: a small positive effect in math, and nothing measurable in reading. The bottom line: summer school helped the students who showed up, but with so few attending, it barely made a dent in overall pandemic losses.</p>

  <h3 class="pub-card-title">The Educational Consequences of Remote and Hybrid Instruction During the Pandemic</h3>
  <p class="pub-card-summary">We analyzed test scores from more than two million students across nearly 10,000 schools in every state to understand how remote learning widened achievement gaps by race and poverty. Remote instruction was the primary driver: math gaps didn't grow in places that stayed in person, though reading gaps widened everywhere. High-poverty districts that went remote now face a sobering reality, as pandemic learning loss may consume nearly all of their federal relief funding.</p>
