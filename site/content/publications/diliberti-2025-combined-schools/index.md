summary: "Combined K-8 schools have long been seen as a smoother path through middle school, sparing students the jarring transition to a new building and culture. And the data backed this up, until the pandemic hit. Looking at 20,000 students, we found that K-8 schools' academic edge largely evaporated during COVID, especially for students learning remotely. The takeaway: the stability these schools provide is real and valuable, but it depends on actually being in the building. When that's gone, so is much of the advantage."
