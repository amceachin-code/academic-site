summary: "We analyzed test scores from more than two million students across nearly 10,000 schools in every state to understand how remote learning widened achievement gaps by race and poverty. Remote instruction was the primary driver: math gaps didn't grow in places that stayed in person, though reading gaps widened everywhere. High-poverty districts that went remote now face a sobering reality, as pandemic learning loss may consume nearly all of their federal relief funding."
