summary: "Every fall, teachers brace for the \"summer slide\" as students return having forgotten much of what they learned. But some researchers have pushed back, arguing that the dip might be a measurement illusion: maybe kids just don't try as hard on fall tests as spring tests. We put that critique to the test, and while we can't say definitively that summer learning loss is real, we also found no evidence that low effort on fall tests is what's driving the pattern. The summer slide remains a genuine puzzle, but this particular explanation doesn't hold up."
