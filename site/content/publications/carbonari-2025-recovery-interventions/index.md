summary: "COVID catch-up programs promised a lot but delivered less than hoped. Across eight school districts in 2022-23, most programs reached fewer students than planned and produced few measurable gains. The exception: intensive interventions like subject-specific tutoring, small-group reading, and placement with highly effective teachers actually moved the needle. The lesson is clear but humbling: intensive support works, it's just really hard to pull off at scale."
