## Software Packages

### horseshoe

Bayesian linear regression with the horseshoe prior (Carvalho, Polson, and Scott, 2010). Implements the horseshoe shrinkage estimator for high-dimensional regression problems where many coefficients are expected to be near zero.

**Languages:** Stata, R (R package name: `hsreg`)

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/amceachin-code/horseshoe](https://github.com/amceachin-code/horseshoe)

### rdtp

Searches over candidate cutoffs on a discrete forcing variable to find the cutoff maximizing R-squared from a linear-spline regression discontinuity design. Based on McEachin, Domina, and Penner (2020, JPAM).

**Languages:** Stata, R
