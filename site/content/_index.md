        I am a Senior Research Director at the [ETS Research Institute](https://www.ets.org/). My research focuses on educational inequality, school choice, math education policy, and discipline disparities. I use causal inference methods to study how policies and programs affect student outcomes, with particular attention to how effects vary across student populations.

        My recent work examines the educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including learning loss, academic recovery interventions, and the effects of remote instruction. My research has been published in the *American Economic Review: Insights*, *American Educational Research Journal*, *Journal of Policy Analysis and Management*, *Journal of Human Resources*, and other leading journals.
