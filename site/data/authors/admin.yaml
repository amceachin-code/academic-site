bio: |
  I am a Senior Research Director at the ETS Research Institute. My research
  focuses on educational inequality, school choice, math education policy, and
  discipline disparities. I use causal inference methods to study how policies
  and programs affect student outcomes, with particular attention to how effects
  vary across student populations.

  My recent work examines the educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,
  including learning loss, academic recovery interventions, and the effects of
  remote instruction. My research has been published in the *American Economic
  Review: Insights*, *American Educational Research Journal*, *Journal of Policy
  Analysis and Management*, *Journal of Human Resources*, and other leading
  journals. I have received over $12 million in research funding from the
  Institute of Education Sciences, the National Institutes of Health, and major
  foundations.
