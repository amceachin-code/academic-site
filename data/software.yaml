    name: horseshoe
    description: >
      Bayesian linear regression with the horseshoe prior (Carvalho, Polson,
      and Scott, 2010). Implements the horseshoe shrinkage estimator for
      high-dimensional regression problems where many coefficients are expected
      to be near zero.

      - Stata

      discontinuity design. Based on McEachin, Domina, and Penner (2020, JPAM).
