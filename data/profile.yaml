bio: >
  I am a Senior Research Director at the ETS Research Institute. My research
  focuses on educational inequality, school choice, math education policy, and
  discipline disparities. I use causal inference methods to study how policies
  and programs affect student outcomes, with particular attention to how effects
  vary across student populations. My recent work examines the educational
  consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, including learning loss, academic
  recovery interventions, and the effects of remote instruction. My research has
  been published in the American Economic Review: Insights, American Educational
  Research Journal, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management, Journal of Human
  Resources, and other leading journals. I have received over $12 million in
  research funding from the Institute of Education Sciences, the National
  Institutes of Health, and major foundations.
