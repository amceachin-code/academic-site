  - key: disrupted_learning
    name: "Out-of-School or Disrupted Learning"
    description: >
      This line of research examines what happens to student learning outside the
      traditional school year and during periods of disruption. My work documents
      summer learning loss patterns, evaluates the effectiveness of summer school
      programs, and studies the educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,
      including the impact of remote instruction and academic recovery interventions.
  - key: accountability
    name: "Accountability"
    description: >
      This research investigates how federal and state accountability policies shape
      educational quality. My work traces the evolution of accountability from No Child
      Left Behind through ESEA waivers to the Every Student Succeeds Act, examining
      how these policies affect teacher quality, school improvement, and the politics
      of education reform.
  - key: exclusionary_practices
    name: "Exclusionary Practices, Discipline, Tracking & Segregation"
    description: >
      This body of work examines how school structures and practices sort students
      in ways that reinforce inequality. My research studies curricular tracking and
      detracking reforms, discipline disparities across student groups, course
      placement decisions, and how school choice and assignment policies shape
      racial and socioeconomic segregation.
  - key: school_choice
    name: "School Choice"
    description: >
      This research evaluates the effects of school choice programs on students and
      school systems. My work examines charter school performance, virtual schooling
      outcomes, cream-skimming in choice markets, and the competitive effects of
      choice policies on traditional public schools.

    summary: "We analyzed test scores from more than two million students across nearly 10,000 schools in every state to understand how remote learning widened achievement gaps by race and poverty. Remote instruction was the primary driver: math gaps didn't grow in places that stayed in person, though reading gaps widened everywhere. High-poverty districts that went remote now face a sobering reality, as pandemic learning loss may consume nearly all of their federal relief funding."
